## About Hilo

### Name

Well, it's a weird name. The reason behind choosing this name is
that the author of Hilo, Erik Royall, likes to write *Hilo Wald*
programs instead of _Hello World_ programs. And when he got the
idea of writing a JavaScript library he used the first word in
*Hilo Wald* as the name for the library. 
_Note: The name **Wald** will undoubtedly be used as a name for_
_his next project so..._
